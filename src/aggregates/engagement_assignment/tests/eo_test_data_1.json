There's a couple of sticky wickets that you will discover:\\n\\n- People don't want to OAuth authenticate to every one of their services individually\\n- Quality of search is difficult - it's easy to do naive searches, but identifying things in context is hard\\n- Most of the services you list aren't very interesting to search across without context - i.e. you search for someone's name and want to get their linkedin profile, their docs they've sent you, their emails, etc.  - which is difficult to do well\\n- You will very quickly hit API limits for most of the providers, since they're designed for single-key lookups, not crawl-type functionality, which leads me to....\\n- Most of the cloud services don't allow you to index their content.  They don't want you to make it easy to duplicate or have users migrate off their services.  This prevents you from making an index locally that you can search against, meaning....\\n- For many services, you have to query in real-time (assuming they even offer a search API).  Now you have to query a bunch of APIs at once, get the results, and contextualize them before your user gets antsy (which is extremely hard if not impossible).\\n\\nSo, sure, great concept, there's even a company that does it:\\n\\nhttps://xen.do/\\n\\nBut there's a lot of technical challenges above and beyond jsut writing connectors to a bunch of APIs.\", \"subreddit\": \"startups\"}, {\"text\": \"Some element on your site is taking forever to load and preventing the page from rendering in any sane amount of time.\", \"subreddit\": \"startups\"}, {\"text\": \"No, it's illegal to block the fire escape for any reason.  \", \"subreddit\": \"nyc\"}, {\"text\": \"You should read \\\"Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\\\", which is the book that kicked off David Simon's career, was turned into a tv show, and from which the wire pulls many of its subplots and anecdotes.\", \"subreddit\": \"nyc\"}, {\"text\": \"There's a couple of ways you can answer this question:\\n\\n- Unique domain expertise - you know something about this particular market that other companies don't.

Our answer to that question from investors was, \\\"Of course, big company X could always get into our market, but in order to do so, they'd have to bring on the unique domain expertise we have, and then duplicate our  thousands of man hours that we've spent identifying all the unique edge cases that we handle.

Each sales rep in a given territory has an allocation that might be done either on a dollar-value basis or a unit basis.  So, one rep might have a 2k budget for shirts and 40 golf umbrellas.  Every time they need an item, the fulfillment house packs and ships and deducts it from the allowance - we don't wnat to deal with that ourselves.\\n\\nThe challenge is that most of the fulfillment houses I know expect that they're fulfilling orders on sales (a la amazon fulfillment) - or they're happy to do the drop shipping for us, but they can't properly track the individual allocations for the different reps.\\n\\nHas anyone worked with a company that does this well, ideally with some sort of nice reporting interface for visualization and accounting purposes?\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n\\nEDIT: from the comments, it seems like people believe this is largely something that should be handled by treating it like a real online store - set up a storefront, give people accounts, charge the money behind the scenes on the backend.

There's a couple of sticky wickets that you will discover:\\n\\n- People don't want to OAuth authenticate to every one of their services individually\\n- Quality of search is difficult - it's easy to do naive searches, but identifying things in context is hard\\n- Most of the services you list aren't very interesting to search across without context - i.e. you search for someone's name and want to get their linkedin profile, their docs they've sent you, their emails, etc.  - which is difficult to do well\\n- You will very quickly hit API limits for most of the providers, since they're designed for single-key lookups, not crawl-type functionality, which leads me to....\\n- Most of the cloud services don't allow you to index their content.  They don't want you to make it easy to duplicate or have users migrate off their services.  This prevents you from making an index locally that you can search against, meaning....\\n- For many services, you have to query in real-time (assuming they even offer a search API).  Now you have to query a bunch of APIs at once, get the results, and contextualize them before your user gets antsy (which is extremely hard if not impossible).\\n\\nSo, sure, great concept, there's even a company that does it:\\n\\nhttps://xen.do/\\n\\nBut there's a lot of technical challenges above and beyond jsut writing connectors to a bunch of APIs.\"},{\"subreddit\":\"startups\",\"text\":\"Some element on your site is taking forever to load and preventing the page from rendering in any sane amount of time.\"},{\"subreddit\":\"nyc\",\"text\":\"No, it's illegal to block the fire escape for any reason.  \"},{\"subreddit\":\"nyc\",\"text\":\"You should read \\\"Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\\\", which is the book that kicked off David Simon's career, was turned into a tv show, and from which the wire pulls many of its subplots and anecdotes.\"},{\"subreddit\":\"startups\",\"text\":\"There's a couple of ways you can answer this question:\\n\\n- Unique domain expertise - you know something about this particular market that other companies don't.  You have felt this pain, you have industry credibility, when you speak on this subject, people listen\\n- Virality/network effect - your product gets inherently better the more people that use it, so when someone else tries to buy their way in, they have to buy the userbase\\n- Technical expertise - whatever you have built is unique/hard enough from a technical standpoint that people who want to copy it will struggle.\\n\\nSo, in the case of my last startup, we were entering a market with a domain-specific type of product that had only frameworks on offer.  Our answer to that question from investors was, \\\"Of course, big company X could always get into our market, but in order to do so, they'd have to bring on the unique domain expertise we have, and then duplicate our  thousands of man hours that we've spent identifying all the unique edge cases that we handle.  They will probably try to do what we do, fail, and then try to acquire us\\\"\\n\\nThat got us funded a number of times, and indeed, that's exactly what happened.\"}]}",
