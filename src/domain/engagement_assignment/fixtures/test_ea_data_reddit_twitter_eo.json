(What is now called `input` was then called `raw_input`). This version of the input function was deemed a security hazard and was never particularly useful. Thus, it was removed and `raw_input` was renamed to `input`. \\n\\nWith that in mind, in python 2, your code essentially does this:\\n    \\n    key_input = eval(input('Please enter a course number:\\\\n'))\\n\\n. So when you input `CS101`, the line becomes:\\n\\n    key_input = eval(\\\"CS101\\\")\\n\\nwhich is equivalent (If you don't know what the `eval` function does, it essentially causes a string to be evauated as code) to\\n\\n    key_input = CS101\\n \\nTo compute this expression, the interpreter has to do a name lookup to decide what object CS101 refers to. So it looks in the current scope for that variable, doesn't find it, then bubbles up, still doesn't find it, and then raises a NameError.\\n\\nIn python 3, this line just returns the string \\\"CS101\\\" of course (since it doesn't try to evaluate it as code) and the code moves on.

A protestant northern hre state, as it ended up. (It'd been taken hundreds of years ago before I was the emperor. I can't keep up with some tiny do-nothing state's religion that long.) This of course has tipped the balance of power right into the dirty protestants' hands, so now it looks like I'm stuck in limbo.\\n\\nHere's a screenshot of Friesland, a typical example of the problem. (He's the closest protestant to voting for the proposal): http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#4\\n\\nMy question is, what the heck can I do to make friesland vote for it?

I would just attack one of the stuck-up minor german states to make him vote with me, but of course langfriede is already enacted, so that's impossible.

Eventually, the blinker would turn on but not flash.  Both directions along with the hazards.  This would only happen intermittently and led me to suspect the flasher relay as the culprit.\\n3.

But then you can simply extract that calculation out, and benchmark in on different versions.\\n\\nBut you do NOT, as you now suggest, have the whole application be one gigantic bottleneck that sometimes are here and sometimes are there and sometimes everywhere.

Let's implement MD5 again :-)\\\",\\\"It is funny that many algorithms have been reimplemented again and again whenever a language needs to provide a standard library.\\\",\\\"Now that I think about it, the ecosystem of a language probably influences adoption more than syntax.\\\",\\\"A programming language is more than syntax and semantics; it's that plus all big and small decisions that make the language ecosystem.\\\",\\\"@sescob27 @dartosphere it's interesting how many are starting to view #golang as a replacement for their main language.\\\",\\\"@sshanx @jezdez @DiceTechJobs that's fair. I mainly pointed that one out as the exact terminology can always be looked up.\\\",\\\"Every time you encounter a #Unicode encoding issue, send the developer to this site: http://t.co/qg8XEcLXv2\\\",\\\"@sshanx @jezdez @DiceTechJobs a better question would be to ask how the semantics of passing arguments works, not the arbitrary term.\\\",\\\"@sshanx @jezdez @DiceTechJobs it also means very few candidates will pass even though they are great developers, team players and so on.\\\",\\\"@sshanx @jezdez @DiceTechJobs in this case I had to look the term up and for what it's worth the Wikipedia entry didn't make things better.\\\",\\\"New blog post about testing the main package in Go! http://t.co/kybBUIW4Lv #golang\\\",\\\"@rasbt if it's a true wiki, everyone could edit and update. If it's one person doing all the work then it gets crazy.\\\",\\\"So, @docker as the most popular Go GitHub project isn't surprising. Second-most popular? A Sublime Text clone: https://t.co/uMt2eSZCbN\\\",\\\"@art_haali that being said, you can change the password and revoke sessions online.\\\",\\\"@StephenAllison7 that's cool. The London Python community is bigger than I thought :)\\\",\\\"@StephenAllison7 I presume you're also working with Python?\\\",\\\"Ready for some science on the go? @rasbt : http://t.co/15nHDHfJvQ\\\",\\\"@kennethlove @treehouse no work on Friday? That's a good one! List of benefits looks pretty good overall I have to say.\\\",\\\"@jan_ekholm @njern that being said, the libraries and ecosystem aren't there yet so it's still a long way to go.\\\",\\\"@jan_ekholm @njern Type safety, concurrency and performance. All good things to have in modern projects. Good alternative for Python or C.\\\",\\\"@jan_ekholm @njern well yes, but so do other challenging projects. Example: Ubuntu forked from Debian and OpenBSD forked from NetBSD.\\\",\\\"@njern @jan_ekholm until Google takes it into a direction people don't like. In that case a fork would be required, which can be problematic\\\",\\\"@fcassia @rasbt yes, though my point was that if the Java language were less verbose, there wouldn't be a need for so many JVM languages.\\\",\\\"@fcassia @rasbt I like that, though the verbosity of Java has led to these JVM languages. You don't need Jython to call Python from Java.\\\",\\\"RT @BoredElonMusk: \\\\\\\"The Dyson Airblade cleans 99.97% of germs off your hands by blasting them onto everyone else in a 10 foot radius.\\\\\\\"\\\",\\\"@fcassia @rasbt oh that's fine, it's just that Python the language is meant, not CPython the implementation. Unless CPython quirks included.\\\",\\\"@jwebster also, the Nikon D3300 came out recently so the Nikon D3200 is cheaper now.\\\",\\\"@njern @jan_ekholm one thing that may be a concern is lack of independent implementation of Go. That would be good for the ecosystem.\\\",\\\"@jwebster I bought the Nikon D3200 and very happy with it. Easy to use on auto but also has all the advanced features.\\\",\\\"@__pmo have you looked at Go? I'm in the process of learning it now and it looks pretty good. #golang\\\",\\\"@fcassia @rasbt technically it's bringing Python to the JVM right, not the specifics of CPython?\\\",\\\"@__pmo I heard good things about D. What are you using it for? Things you'd originally write in C++?\\\",\\\"@rasbt for me, all it takes is Python 3 support for boto. After that the production systems can run Python 3: http://t.co/SZnNyLq0sg\\\"],\\\"followers_count\\\":245,\\\"location\\\":\\\"London, United Kingdom\\\"}\", \"system_created_date\": \"2014-06-07T02:05:53.358Z\", \"prospect\": 19}, \"pk\": 15, \"model\": \"profile.profile\"}]",

Just mentioned it for completeness.\\\"},{\\\"subreddit\\\":\\\"learnpython\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"I'm going to assume that you were actually running it in python 2 originally.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, a bit of history: in python 2, the `input` function was equivalent to `eval(input())` in python 3. (What is now called `input` was then called `raw_input`). This version of the input function was deemed a security hazard and was never particularly useful. Thus, it was removed and `raw_input` was renamed to `input`. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, in python 2, your code essentially does this:\\\\n    \\\\n    key_input = eval(input('Please enter a course number:\\\\\\\\n'))\\\\n\\\\n. So when you input `CS101`, the line becomes:\\\\n\\\\n    key_input = eval(\\\\\\\"CS101\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nwhich is equivalent (If you don't know what the `eval` function does, it essentially causes a string to be evauated as code) to\\\\n\\\\n    key_input = CS101\\\\n \\\\nTo compute this expression, the interpreter has to do a name lookup to decide what object CS101 refers to. So it looks in the current scope for that variable, doesn't find it, then bubbles up, still doesn't find it, and then raises a NameError.\\\\n\\\\nIn python 3, this line just returns the string \\\\\\\"CS101\\\\\\\" of course (since it doesn't try to evaluate it as code) and the code moves on. It still blows up when it gets to `courses` though, since that variable is undefined.\\\"},{\\\"subreddit\\\":\\\"learnpython\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"What's wrong with good old `spam = spam + 1`?\\\\n\\\\nIf you really want, you can do `spam += 1`.

The problem is that austria, who provided the first 7 emperors and ruled for the first 160 years, went protestant this game. Unfortunately, I did not. The result is a sort of half-protestant, half-catholic mess of a HRE that reminds me of marble cake. \\\\n\\\\nHre: http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#1\\\\n\\\\nReligious map: http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#2\\\\n\\\\nNow, when voting for things, it essentially ends up being the catholic league vs the northern/eastern protestants. This balance of power was previously fine (the catholics won by one vote), but during a war with dennmark, I did the right thing and freed a northern hre state. A protestant northern hre state, as it ended up. (It'd been taken hundreds of years ago before I was the emperor. I can't keep up with some tiny do-nothing state's religion that long.) This of course has tipped the balance of power right into the dirty protestants' hands, so now it looks like I'm stuck in limbo.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a screenshot of Friesland, a typical example of the problem. (He's the closest protestant to voting for the proposal): http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#4\\\\n\\\\nMy question is, what the heck can I do to make friesland vote for it? We're already at 200 relations and I've done almost everything I can think of to make him vote for me. But I can't get past that combined -30 voting hit for not being german and not being protestant. \\\\n\\\\nI didn't remember how it worked, so I moved my capital from Rome to Bern in hopes of becoming germanic to get rid of the -10 modifier, but that didn't do anything. I would just attack one of the stuck-up minor german states to make him vote with me, but of course langfriede is already enacted, so that's impossible. As a result of some war that I was not somehow involved in, pomerania got split in two and turned catholic, putting the vote at 12-13.

That's kind of a problem.  I'm currently trying to sort out what it could possibly be and *think* that the hazard switch may have gone kaput.  My problem is that I do not fully understand the continuity check diagram.  Here's a rundown of the issue as it developed over time.\\\\n\\\\n1.  Initially, when I flipped on the blinkers, the speedo would slam down to zero and then almost immediately rebound *(I never actually could figure out what the deal with that was)*.\\\\n2.  Eventually, the blinker would turn on but not flash.  Both directions along with the hazards.  This would only happen intermittently and led me to suspect the flasher relay as the culprit.\\\\n3.  Now, nothing works.  No blinkers, no hazards.  Replaced the flasher relay with no resolution.  I drove the truck a bit and when I turned it off, the flasher relay was quite hot despite not working.  Not entirely sure what to make of that.\\\\n\\\\n[Here is the wiring diagram in question](http://imgur.com/NQ9hfqx).  There's not a whole lot of things that can take down both the blinkers **and** the hazards.  I believe that the ground may be open (top diagram, the \\\\\\\"3s\\\\\\\"), either that or the wiring shit itself.  I want to check that the hazard switch itself isn't broken so I pulled it and am performing the continuity checks (bottom diagram).  However, I don't believe I understand what the illumination part of the diagram means (the lower red arrow).  .\\\\nFrom my reading of the diagram, the switch should light up.  As far as I remember, it has NEVER lit up and it doesn't make a ton of sense for a light (if it did have one) to get its' power from the taillight control relay.  The resistance across terminal 2 &amp; 3 is &gt; 200k ohms so I'll it \\\\\\\"open\\\\\\\".  Am I reading this diagram correctly?  Is my reasoning sound?  \\\\n\\\\nedit: accidentally a word\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"How to Politely React to Your Friend's Terrible Engagement!\\\",\\\"subreddit\\\":\\\"videos\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"title\\\":\\\"[live] Puppy TV.

I wanted to keep it pretty small, and ended up only adding about an extra 50% of height to the header. Basically, I feel the same as you - I don&#39;t want the header to be enormous. So this is my attempt to keep it small!</p>\\\\n</div>\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/27hlr0/welcome_to_rpythons_new_theme/ci0yllx\\\"}\", \"engagement_opportunity_external_id\": \"ci0yllx\", \"provider_action_type\": 2, \"engagement_opportunity_uid\": \"72f61900-ede8-11e3-9bfa-b8f6b1160971\", \"system_created_date\": \"2014-06-07T02:07:16.817Z\", \"profile\": 18}, \"pk\": 36, \"model\": \"engagement_opportunity.engagementopportunity\"}]",

(Semi-pseudo code, so don&#39;t attack me.)</p>\\\\n\\\\n<pre><code>num = 100\\\\nwhile num &gt; 0:\\\\n    print(&quot;IN TABLE TABLENAME CREATE ROW %BUILDING%-%ROOM%-&quot; + num)\\\\n    num = num - 1\\\\n</code></pre>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I obviously could have done something a little more clever to print it all out at once, but I just wanted to complete this task quickly without much thought, as I was really only going to use it once. I threw the output into SQL Management Studio and called it a day.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>I&#39;m also aware I could have connected with the SQL database directly to make this even faster, but again, was just something quick.</p>\\\\n</div>\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/27gumv/share_your_helper_scripts/ci0xva1\\\"}\", \"engagement_opportunity_external_id\": \"ci0xva1\", \"provider_action_type\": 2, \"engagement_opportunity_uid\": \"74a0f052-ede8-11e3-af32-b8f6b1160971\", \"system_created_date\": \"2014-06-07T02:07:19.614Z\", \"profile\": 27}, \"pk\": 66, \"model\": \"engagement_opportunity.engagementopportunity\"}]",

(What is now called `input` was then called `raw_input`). This version of the input function was deemed a security hazard and was never particularly useful. Thus, it was removed and `raw_input` was renamed to `input`. \\n\\nWith that in mind, in python 2, your code essentially does this:\\n    \\n    key_input = eval(input('Please enter a course number:\\\\n'))\\n\\n. So when you input `CS101`, the line becomes:\\n\\n    key_input = eval(\\\"CS101\\\")\\n\\nwhich is equivalent (If you don't know what the `eval` function does, it essentially causes a string to be evauated as code) to\\n\\n    key_input = CS101\\n \\nTo compute this expression, the interpreter has to do a name lookup to decide what object CS101 refers to. So it looks in the current scope for that variable, doesn't find it, then bubbles up, still doesn't find it, and then raises a NameError.\\n\\nIn python 3, this line just returns the string \\\"CS101\\\" of course (since it doesn't try to evaluate it as code) and the code moves on.

The problem is that austria, who provided the first 7 emperors and ruled for the first 160 years, went protestant this game. Unfortunately, I did not. The result is a sort of half-protestant, half-catholic mess of a HRE that reminds me of marble cake. \\n\\nHre: http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#1\\n\\nReligious map: http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#2\\n\\nNow, when voting for things, it essentially ends up being the catholic league vs the northern/eastern protestants. This balance of power was previously fine (the catholics won by one vote), but during a war with dennmark, I did the right thing and freed a northern hre state. A protestant northern hre state, as it ended up. (It'd been taken hundreds of years ago before I was the emperor. I can't keep up with some tiny do-nothing state's religion that long.) This of course has tipped the balance of power right into the dirty protestants' hands, so now it looks like I'm stuck in limbo.\\n\\nHere's a screenshot of Friesland, a typical example of the problem. (He's the closest protestant to voting for the proposal): http://imgur.com/qojM4Zv,TtJUFVi,p5AhZgJ,1jd6lOQ,1IMMyYV#4\\n\\nMy question is, what the heck can I do to make friesland vote for it? We're already at 200 relations and I've done almost everything I can think of to make him vote for me. But I can't get past that combined -30 voting hit for not being german and not being protestant. \\n\\nI didn't remember how it worked, so I moved my capital from Rome to Bern in hopes of becoming germanic to get rid of the -10 modifier, but that didn't do anything. I would just attack one of the stuck-up minor german states to make him vote with me, but of course langfriede is already enacted, so that's impossible. As a result of some war that I was not somehow involved in, pomerania got split in two and turned catholic, putting the vote at 12-13.

If you don't know, or there are no clear bottlenecks, then the app is doing a little bit of everything all the time, and then you will not encounter any disastrous performance degradation.\\n\\nThe integer performance being 20% slower will ONLY result in a 20% slowdown *if integer performance is the bottleneck*!\\n\\n&gt; You probably have to assign a weight to each component to determine how much it contributes under different scenarios and then run a large set of performance/load tests to validate those weights while checking all code paths.\\n\\nIf you have performance problems, you have bottlenecks.

But then you can simply extract that calculation out, and benchmark in on different versions.\\n\\nBut you do NOT, as you now suggest, have the whole application be one gigantic bottleneck that sometimes are here and sometimes are there and sometimes everywhere.
